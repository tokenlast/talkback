# Installing Live Jev

Written for people and for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and the like). Every step has a check.


## 0. Prerequisites
| You need | Check | If missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or later), macOS 14 or later | `uname -m` prints `arm64`; `sw_vers -productVersion` is 14 or higher | Not supported (Intel Macs are not supported) |
| Ableton Live 12 | Live starts | — |
| Xcode Command Line Tools | `xcode-select -p` prints a path | `xcode-select --install` |
| Homebrew Python 3.13 | `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13 --version` | `brew install python@3.13` (Homebrew: <https://brew.sh>) |
| A TypeSafe API key | — | Sign in at <https://console.typesafe.ai/> and create one (docs: <https://docs.typesafe.ai/>). It is a paid API; check TypeSafe’s site for pricing |

**Note for AI assistants:** ask the user to enter the API key themselves. Never write the key to a file you create, a log, or a commit. Ask the user to do step 3 (it happens in Live’s settings window).

## 1. Get the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/okinaaudio/live-jev.git ~/live-jev
cd ~/live-jev
```
**Important:** the app runs `daemon.py` from this folder. **Do not move or delete the folder after building the app** (if you move it, repeat step 5). Decide where it should live before you continue.

Check: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13 -m unittest discover -s tests` ends with `OK`.

## 2. Install the Remote Script
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Music/Ableton/User\ Library/Remote\ Scripts/LiveJev
cp remote_script/LiveJev/*.py ~/Music/Ableton/User\ Library/Remote\ Scripts/LiveJev/
```
If you moved your User Library, put it in `Remote Scripts/LiveJev/` under the location shown in Live’s Settings → Library.

## 3. Enable it in Live (done by the user)
Start Live → Settings → **Link, Tempo & MIDI** → **Control Surface** → choose **LiveJev** in a free slot → **restart Live**. Leave Input and Output set to None.

Check (with Live running):
```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13 plugin_script.py ping     # → pong
```

## 4. Set your API key
```bash
echo 'export TYPESAFE_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
The key is read from the `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` environment variable, or from an `export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...` line in `~/.zshenv`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`.

Check (with Live running; this does not change your set):
```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13 cli.py status           # → one line such as "Live 12 tracks / 120 BPM"
```

## 5. Build the app
```bash
bash scripts/build-app.sh          # → ~/Applications/Live Jev.app
open ~/Applications/Live\ Jev.app
```
A waveform icon appears in the menu bar. There is no Dock icon.

On first launch a **Setup** window opens. It checks the three things above for you: the Remote Script (and can install or update it), the connection to Live, and the API key. You can paste the key there instead of step 4; it is stored in your macOS Keychain and handed to the background service when it starts. Reopen the window any time from the menu bar icon → **Setup…**.

## 6. Use it
Bring Live to the front and press **⌘⇧Space**. The bar opens and starts listening immediately. Say “mute”, then pause for one second or press Enter. The bar disappears at once and Live stays in front. Typing stops dictation for that command. Escape or pressing ⌘⇧Space again cancels. The first spoken command asks for Microphone and Speech Recognition access; both are required for on-device dictation. Live Jev only comes back when it needs to ask you something. To undo the last successful command, including a success with a hidden result row, summon the bar and press ⌘Z.

Check from Terminal (mutes the selected track, then unmutes it):
```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13 cli.py "mute" && /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13 cli.py "unmute"
```

## Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Where to look |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin_script.py ping` prints `no answer` | Did you choose LiveJev in step 3 and restart Live afterwards? Live’s log (`~/Library/Preferences/Ableton/Live 12.*/Log.txt`) should contain `LiveJev: started, listening on port 9140` |
| “The Jev API key was not found.” | Is the line from step 4 in your shell profile? Quit and reopen the app after adding it |
| `build-app.sh` says swift was not found | `xcode-select --install` |
| `build-app.sh` says `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13` is missing | `brew install python@3.13` |
| Nothing happens on ⌘⇧Space | Menu bar waveform icon → Show. Check that no other app uses the same shortcut |
| The bar opens but does not listen | In System Settings → Privacy & Security, allow Live Jev under both Microphone and Speech Recognition |
| The app keeps saying “Starting background service…” | The cloned folder was moved or deleted (see step 1). Put it back, or repeat step 5 |
| “Python was not found” in `~/Library/Logs/LiveJev.log` | The app looks for Python in this order: `LIVE_JEV_PYTHON`, a Python bundled inside the app, `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`, `/usr/local/bin/python3`, `/usr/bin/python3` |
| A plug-in name is not understood | Does the plug-in show up in Live’s browser? You can pin a nickname in `plugin_aliases.json`, for example `{"valhalla": "ValhallaVintageVerb"}` |

## Uninstall
Delete `~/Applications/Live Jev.app`, `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts/LiveJev/` and the cloned folder, remove the `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` line from your shell profile, and set the Control Surface slot in Live back to None.
